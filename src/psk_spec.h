 *  Xiegu X6100 LVGL GUI - PSK31 spectrum for the waterfall display
 *
 *  Separate from psk_rx.c on purpose: a display feature has no business
 *  reaching into the decoder. It is fed the same audio the decoder gets
 *  (PSK_RX_RATE), through a tap, and costs one 2048 point FFT per line.
 *
 *  2048 points at 12000 Hz give 5.86 Hz bins, so a PSK31 signal (about
 *  60 Hz wide) spans roughly a dozen bins and its two idle sidebands are
 *  resolved. Lines come at a fixed 10.77 per second whatever the rate
 *  (every 1115 samples at 12000 Hz), so a 325 pixel waterfall holds 30
 *  seconds and the window's per-line averaging (snap, squelch) keeps the
 *  time constants it was tuned with.
 *
 *  Output is dB relative to the median of the displayed bins, so the
 *  noise floor sits near zero whatever the AF and RF gain are and the
 *  display limits never need retuning.

 * neighbour, and following it would walk the receiver off its signal.
 * Measured on synthetic signals, with lines averaged at 0.05 per line
 * as the PSK31 window does: at -12 dB in 2.5 kHz the error is 1.9 Hz
 * rms (5.4 Hz worst of 100) for an idle signal and 0.9 Hz rms for
