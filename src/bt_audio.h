/*
 * bt_audio.h - Bluetooth headset audio: listening and PTT.
 *
 * Listening: a PulseAudio loopback from the radio's capture device to
 * the Bluetooth sink (A2DP, or HFP once PTT has been used).
 *
 * PTT: the headset microphone goes to the radio's transmitter. The card
 * is switched to HFP (handsfree_head_unit), a second loopback carries
 * the HFP source into the codec output and the BASE is keyed with
 * radio_set_modem(), as the voice messages do. Record mode
 * (AUDIO_PLAY_ON) is not used: with it set the radio did not key.
 *
 * Headset button: a short press of the headset's main button toggles
 * PTT (see bt_audio.c).
 *
 * HFP needs the musb patch in the kernel (AetherX6100Buildroot
 * 07a8d25, "Add BT patch for HSP/HFP duplex support"); without it the
 * SCO link dies after a few seconds. The card stays in HFP after the
 * first PTT, because switching profiles takes one to two seconds and
 * would eat the start of every over.
 *
 * All pactl calls run on one worker thread. The UI only reads cached
 * state and posts requests; every function here is safe to call from
 * the LVGL thread.
