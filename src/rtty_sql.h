 *  Xiegu X6100 LVGL GUI - RTTY squelch
 *
 *  The RTTY bit decision only compares which of the two tones is
 *  stronger, so with no signal it still flips on noise and the framing
 *  now and then lines up by chance, printing junk. This gate also
 *  requires the band to contain something: characters pass only while
 *  the energy in the two tone bins is above a level set by the operator.
 *
 *  The threshold is an ABSOLUTE level, not an offset from a tracked
 *  noise floor. A tracked floor made the gate move by itself: a strong
 *  station lifts the floor estimate and the effective threshold drifts
 *  with it. A fixed level behaves like the squelch on a conventional
 *  radio - set once for the band and it stays put. The floor is still
 *  estimated, but only to show where the noise sits.
 *
 *  Stored in the settings database as "rtty_squelch" (0..90, 0 = off),
 *  the same key the v0.34 build used.
